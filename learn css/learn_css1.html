	<!-- 3 Methods for Adding CSS -->
	<!-- 1. Inline CSS --- which means applying style directly in the html element (NOT SUGGESTED)
		 2. Internal CSS --- which means applying style(using style tag) within a single document (SOMETIMES SUGGESTED)
		 3. External CSS --- which means applying style with linking an external .css file (MOST EFFICIENT WAY)
